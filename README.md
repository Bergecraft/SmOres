SmOres
=======

SmOres (Smelting-Ores) is a Bukkit plugin that changes the behavior of ores, smelting, and picks.

##Ores

All ores will always drop as single blocks, no Silk Touch or Fortune enchantments needed. This applies to blocks broken by a player or an explosion.

##Smelting

Furnaces only work for food; ores, sand, logs, and clay cannot be baked/smelted in a furnace. See [FactoryMod](https://github.com/Bergecraft/FactoryMod/wiki) for converting these items.

##Picks

Gold materials are re-purposed as Copper/Bronze, an intermediary between Stone and Iron tools. Stone picks can break Gold (Copper) Ore, Gold (Bronze) picks can break Iron Ore (and Lapis), but Stone picks cannot break Iron Ore. The same logic applies to the corresponding craftable blocks. Thus the material progression is Wood, Stone, Bronze, Iron, Diamond.
